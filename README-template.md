## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me understand better how to use Tailwind CSS for styling while maintaining a clean structure. One of the key things I learned was how to create hover effects efficiently:

```html
<button class="hover:bg-lime-400 hover:text-zinc-700">GitHub</button>
```

Additionally, I refined my ability to center elements using `flex` and `self-center`.

```css
body {
  @apply flex flex-col h-screen gap-6 items-center justify-center bg-zinc-900;
}
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I want to:
- Improve my responsiveness handling using Tailwindâ€™s utility classes.
- Explore better ways to structure my HTML to enhance accessibility.
- Work with more complex components in Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me quickly apply styles without writing custom CSS.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - A great platform to practice frontend development with real-world challenges.
